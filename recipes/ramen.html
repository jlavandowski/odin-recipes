    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>Ramen is delicious. Surely you know this. But if you've ever watched the Anime series Naruto, then you will definitely know that our main man Naruto can scarf down this Miso Chashu Pork Ramen with the power of the nine-tailed demon fox</p>
    </h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
            <li>About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a box, the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the paste)</li>
            <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Baby bok choy</li>
            <li>1 Green onion</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients for optional indulgence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aburage - that’s those brown sticks on the right side of the bowl, it’s a type of soy product that’s used when you make inari-zushi</li>
            <li>Nori - it’s those black/green sheets sticking out of the back</li>
            <li>Kamaboko - This is that white thing with the pink swirl.  Its made of a sort of fish paste that is steamed into like a cake</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through</li>
            <li>Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool</li>
            <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook</li>
            <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices</li>
            <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!</li>
        </ol>
